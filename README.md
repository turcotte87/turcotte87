### Hi there <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif"/>

I'm Philippe, a computer science student and passionate lifelong learner based in Quebec City.  

I currently work as a **Full Stack Software Developer** at [MICA](https://www.micasf.com), where I contribute to building impactful tools that empower financial advisors and their clients.  

My academic journey reflects my curiosity for diverse fields. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Finance and have nearly completed a Master's degree in Audiology before deciding to pursue my passion for Computer Science. This variety of experiences has shaped the way I think and strengthened my ability to approach problems from multiple perspectives.

I’m fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products that make a real difference in people’s lives.  

Outside of work, you’ll often find me exploring new scientific discoveries, training at the gym, running and preparing for a future marathon, immersing myself in video games, enjoying time in nature.

**Always happy to connect and share ideas, feel free to reach out!**
